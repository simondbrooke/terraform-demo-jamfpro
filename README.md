## Environment Setup

This project supports three environments:

1. Sandbox
2. Staging
3. Production

Each environment has its own Terraform Cloud workspace:

- `terraform-jamfpro-sandbox`
- `terraform-jamfpro-staging`
- `terraform-jamfpro-production`

## Workflow Overview

1. Developers create short-lived branches prefixed with `feature-`, `bugfix-`, `hotfix-`, `chore-`, `config-`, `docs-`, or `test-`.
2. Changes are automatically applied to the Sandbox environment when pushed from these branches to sandbox.
3. Once all desired changes have been tested and merged into the sandbox branch, the promotion to Staging begins:
   a. The "02 - release and terraform plan to: staging" workflow is manually triggered from the sandbox branch.
   b. This workflow creates a new version and a new release branch (e.g., `release-v1.2.3`).
   c. It then generates a Terraform plan for the Staging environment using this release branch.
   d. A pull request is created from the release branch to the staging branch, with the plan for review.
4. After the pull request is reviewed and approved:
   a. The pull request is merged into the staging branch.
   b. This triggers the "03 - terraform apply to: staging" workflow.
   c. The workflow checks that the merge is from a release branch (starting with `release-v`), then applies the Terraform changes to the Staging environment.
   d. After successful apply, the release branch is cleaned up (deleted).
5. The process for promoting to Production follows a similar pattern with its own workflows:
   a. A new release and plan workflow is manually triggered from the staging branch.
   b. A new release branch is created for production promotion.
   c. After review and approval, the changes are applied to the Production environment.
   d. The production release branch is cleaned up after successful apply.

This approach ensures that each promotion to staging or production is associated with a specific release version, allowing for version tracking and potential rollback if needed.

## Branching Strategy

Our branching strategy consists of long-lived branches, short-lived feature branches, and temporary release branches. Here's a detailed breakdown:

| Branch Type | Branch Name | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|-------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Long-lived  | `sandbox`   | Represents the sandbox environment. All feature branches are merged here first. | Permanent |
| Long-lived  | `staging`   | Represents the staging environment. Release branches are merged here for testing before production. | Permanent |
| Long-lived  | `production` | Represents the production environment. Final destination for all changes. | Permanent |
| Short-lived | `feature-*`  | For developing new features | Merged to `sandbox` when complete, then deleted |
| Short-lived | `bugfix-*`   | For fixing bugs | Merged to `sandbox` when complete, then deleted |
| Short-lived | `hotfix-*`   | For critical fixes that need to be deployed quickly | Can be merged directly to `staging` or `production` in emergencies, then backported to `sandbox` |
| Short-lived | `chore-*`    | For maintenance tasks | Merged to `sandbox` when complete, then deleted |
| Short-lived | `config-*`   | For configuration changes | Merged to `sandbox` when complete, then deleted |
| Short-lived | `docs-*`     | For documentation updates | Merged to `sandbox` when complete, then deleted |
| Short-lived | `test-*`     | For adding or updating tests | Merged to `sandbox` when complete, then deleted |
| Temporary   | `release-v*` | Created for each release to staging or production | Created during release process, used for final review and applying changes, then deleted after successful apply |

### Notes

- Hotfixes may bypass the normal flow in emergencies, but should be backported to ensure all environments stay in sync.
- Release branches (`release-v*`) are temporary and serve as a stable point for final testing and deployment. They are deleted after successful merge and apply.
- Long-lived branches (`sandbox`, `staging`, `production`) should never be deleted and represent the state of each environment.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Terraform Apply to Sandbox** (`01-terraform-sandbox.yml`)
   - Triggered on push to branches prefixed with `feature-`, `bugfix-`, `hotfix-`, `chore-`, `config-`, `docs-`, or `test-`
   - Also can be manually triggered with a specified branch name
   - Applies changes directly to the Sandbox environment using Terraform Cloud
   - Validates branch name for manual runs
   - Uses the `terraform-jamfpro-sandbox` workspace in Terraform Cloud

## Getting Started

1. **Fork or Clone Repository**: Start by forking or cloning this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Configure Github Secrets**: Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
    - `TF_API_TOKEN`: Your Terraform Cloud API token for Terraform Cloud backend.

3. **Configure Terraform Cloud Secrets**: Set up the following secrets in your Terraform Cloud workspace variable settings for each environment (Sandbox, Staging, Production):
    - `JAMFPRO_INSTANCE_FQDN`: Your Jamf Pro instance URL. For example: `https://your-instance.jamfcloud.com`.
    - `JAMFPRO_AUTH_METHOD`: Can be either `basic` or `oauth2`.
    - `JAMFPRO_CLIENT_ID`: Your Jamf Pro client id when `JAMFPRO_AUTH_METHOD` is set to 'oauth2'.
    - `JAMFPRO_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Jamf Pro client secret when `JAMFPRO_AUTH_METHOD` is set to 'oauth2'.
    - `JAMFPRO_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`: Your Jamf Pro username when `JAMFPRO_AUTH_METHOD` is set to 'basic'.
    - `JAMFPRO_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`: Your Jamf Pro user password when `JAMFPRO_AUTH_METHOD` is set to 'basic'.

   Note: For Terraform Cloud, when setting variables you do not need to prefix your env vars with `TF_VAR_` as Terraform Cloud automatically does this for you. Additionally, ensure to select the variable category as `Terraform variable`, with the HCL tickbox unchecked.

4. **Update Terraform Variables**: Modify the `terraform` block in your `.tf` files to match your Jamf Pro instance details. For example:

   ```hcl
   provider "jamfpro" {
     jamfpro_instance_fqdn                = var.jamfpro_instance_fqdn
     jamfpro_load_balancer_lock           = var.jamfpro_jamf_load_balancer_lock
     auth_method                          = var.jamfpro_auth_method
     client_id                            = var.jamfpro_client_id
     client_secret                        = var.jamfpro_client_secret
     log_level                            = var.jamfpro_log_level
     log_output_format                    = var.jamfpro_log_output_format
     log_console_separator                = var.jamfpro_log_console_separator
     log_export_path                      = var.jamfpro_log_export_path
     export_logs                          = var.jamfpro_export_logs
     hide_sensitive_data                  = var.jamfpro_hide_sensitive_data
     token_refresh_buffer_period_seconds  = var.jamfpro_token_refresh_buffer_period_seconds
     mandatory_request_delay_milliseconds = var.jamfpro_mandatory_request_delay_milliseconds
   }
   ```

   It's strongly recommended for beginners to ensure that `jamfpro_load_balancer_lock` is set to true, to avoid any issues with the Jamf Pro load balancer.

5. **Backend Configuration**: For our multi-environment setup, we'll be using Terraform workspaces. This approach allows us to use a single set of configuration files while maintaining separate states for each environment. Here's how to structure it:

   In your main Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`):

   ```hcl
    terraform {
      cloud {
        organization = "deploymenttheory"
        workspaces {
          tags = ["Jamf Pro"]
        }
      }
    }
   ```

   This configuration tells Terraform to use Terraform Cloud with the "deploymenttheory" organization and to work with any workspace tagged with "jamfpro".

   In Terraform Cloud:
   1. Create three workspaces:
      - `terraform-jamfpro-sandbox`
      - `terraform-jamfpro-staging`
      - `terraform-jamfpro-production`
   2. Tag each of these workspaces with the "jamfpro" tag.
   3. Set workspace-specific variables in Terraform Cloud for each environment. For example, you might have a variable `environment` set to "sandbox", "staging", or "production" in the respective workspaces.

   In your Terraform configuration, you can then use these workspace-specific variables to customize resources for each environment. For example:

   ```hcl
   resource "jamfpro_building" "example" {
     name = "Building-${var.environment}"
     // other attributes...
   }
   ```

   This approach ensures that each environment has its own isolated state in Terraform Cloud while allowing you to use a single set of configuration files. It provides flexibility in managing environment-specific configurations through Terraform Cloud workspace variables.

   Remember to set up appropriate access controls and variable values for each workspace in Terraform Cloud to maintain proper separation between environments.

6. **Terraform Provider Configuration**: Specify the provider source and version:

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       jamfpro = {
         source  = "deploymenttheory/jamfpro"
         version = "0.1.12"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Define Your Resources**: Use Terraform resource definitions to manage your Jamf Pro resources.

8. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch with the appropriate prefix (`feature-`, `bugfix-`, or `release-`).

9. **Make Changes and Push**: Make your changes and push to GitHub.

10. **Promote to Sandbox**: The "Promote to Sandbox" workflow will automatically run.

11. **Promote to Staging**: After testing in Sandbox, create a pull request to merge into the `staging` branch.

12. **Promote to Production**: Once approved and merged to staging, create another pull request to merge `staging` into `production`.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Promote to Sandbox** (`promote-to-sandbox.yml`)
   - Triggered on push to branches prefixed with `feature-`, `bugfix-`, or `release-`
   - Applies changes to the Sandbox environment

2. **Promote to Staging** (`promote-to-staging.yml`)
   - Triggered on pull request to the `staging` branch
   - Plans changes for the Staging environment
   - Applies changes when the PR is merged

3. **Promote to Production** (`promote-to-production.yml`)
   - Triggered on pull request to the `production` branch
   - Plans changes for the Production environment
   - Applies changes when the PR is merged

## Drift Detection and Correction

The `drift-detection-correction.yml` workflow runs nightly to detect and correct any drift in your environments:

- Checks for drift in Sandbox, Staging, and Production environments
- Automatically corrects drift if detected
- Sends notifications (configure as needed)

## Example Terraform Resource

Below is an example of defining a building in Jamf Pro using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "jamfpro_building" "example_building" {
  name            = "Example Building"
  street_address1 = "123 Example St"
  street_address2 = "Suite 100"
  city            = "Example City"
  state_province  = "Example State"
  zip_postal_code = "12345"
  country         = "Example Country"
}
```

## Security and Best Practices

- Use Terraform Cloud for secure state management
- Implement branch protection rules for `staging` and `production` branches
- Review all plans before applying changes
- Use least-privilege principle for API credentials
- Ensure sensitive data like `client_secret` is marked as sensitive in Terraform and securely stored in GitHub Secrets
- Always review Terraform plans before merging into the main branch to prevent unintended changes
- Limit access to the GitHub repository and associated secrets to authorized personnel only

## Troubleshooting

- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Verify Terraform Cloud workspace configurations
- Ensure Jamf Pro API credentials are correct and have necessary permissions
